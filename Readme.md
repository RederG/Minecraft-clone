## MY MINECRAFT CLONE

# Intro

Hello everyone ! 

I am RederG and after I learn some OpenGL, I started to apply them by creating a Minecraft clone.

I hope that this project will grow and I'll progress with OpenGL.

# Helps with the game

Commands : 
- WSAD keys and mouse for moving around the world
- Shift for going down and Space for going up
- Ctrl for increasing movement speed

With more information, this project was made on Windows so I don't know if it will work on anpther platform. Sorry for that

## ENJOY THE GAME !!!
